# SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
SDLC is the process that defines the stages of software development, from the initial idea to deployment and ongoing maintenance. It includes the following main phases:

## Requirements Gathering
— Determining what the software should do.

## Analysis
— Analyzing requirements and preparing technical documentation.

## Design
— Creating the system architecture and design.

## Development / Coding
— Programming according to the requirements and design.

## Testing
— Verifying the software for bugs and compliance with requirements.

## Deployment
— Releasing the product into the production environment.

## Maintenance
— Fixing bugs, applying updates, and providing ongoing support after release.

# STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
STLC is a set of phases that testers follow to ensure the quality of the software product. It is a part of SDLC but is entirely focused on the testing process.

The phases of STLC are:

## Requirement Analysis
— Understanding the requirements from a testing perspective.

## Test Planning
— Defining the testing strategy, resources, and schedule.

## Test Case Design / Development
— Writing test cases and preparing test data.

## Test Environment Setup
— Setting up the infrastructure required for testing.

## Test Execution
— Running test cases and logging the results.

## Test Closure
— Analyzing completed work and preparing test reports.

## Key Difference:
SDLC covers the entire software development process.
STLC focuses exclusively on the testing process and is a subset of SDLC.

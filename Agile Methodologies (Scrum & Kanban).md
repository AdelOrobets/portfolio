## Agile Methodologies (Scrum & Kanban)

### What is Agile?

**Agile** is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes:
- Collaboration
- Customer feedback
- Rapid delivery of small, working software increments

Agile delivers value continuously and adapts quickly to change.

### Scrum

**Scrum** is a popular Agile framework organizing work into short time-boxed iterations called **Sprints** (usually 1–4 weeks).

**Key Roles:**
- **Product Owner** – Defines product vision and backlog
- **Scrum Master** – Facilitates the process and removes blockers
- **Development Team** – Builds the product increment

**Core Components:**
- **Sprint:** Fixed-length iteration delivering a working product increment
- **Sprint Planning:** Decides what to build in the sprint
- **Daily Stand-up:** 15-minute daily sync meeting
- **Sprint Review:** Demonstrates completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Reflects on process improvements

### Kanban

**Kanban** focuses on visualizing workflow and limiting work in progress (WIP).

**Key Principles:**
- **Visualize the work:** Use a Kanban board with columns like To Do, In Progress, Done
- **Limit WIP:** Restrict how many tasks are in progress at once
- **Optimize flow:** Improve how tasks move through the process

**Example Kanban Board:**

| To Do       | In Progress | Done         |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Feature A   | Bug Fix B   | Setup Repo   |
| Task C      |             |              |

### Scrum vs Kanban (Quick Comparison)

| Feature       | Scrum                        | Kanban                     |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Time-boxed    | Yes (Sprints)                | No                         |
| Roles         | Scrum Master, Product Owner  | Not required               |
| Planning      | Sprint-based                 | Continuous                 |
| Board         | Reset each sprint            | Ongoing                    |
| Flexibility   | Moderate                    | High                       |
